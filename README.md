## Installation
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
1. This portfolio application requires the installation of node.js and the node package manager(npm) which is a software manager and installer which places the modules so that the node project can utilize it, and also, it manages dependency conflicts intelligently and initialized using **npm init**". The package.json will be generated and will contains all the packages of the application in which the user have inputted during the npm initialization.

2. This react application is created by entering at command prompt: 
-npx create-react-app 20S-react-portfolio
-npm install
-npm start (run the apps in the development and http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser)
-npm install react-icons --save (for including the popular icons easily with react-icons which utilizes ES6 imports that allows inclusion of icons for this application)
-https://iconify.design/ (for my popular icon sets used in skills)
-npm install @emailjs/browser
-npm run build (builds the app for production to the folder to correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance)
